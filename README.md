# Project Description
Part 1: Docker file Creation, GitHub and Docker Hub Integration

## Detail
In this part, you will create a Docker file for a sample application, push the Docker image to your Docker Hub registry, and push the codebase to GitHub. The following are the steps you need to follow:
- **Step 1 (5 marks):** Identify a Sample Application
    - Choose a sample application that you want to containerize using Docker. It can be any simple application, such as a "Hello World" program or a web application.
- **Step 2 (5 marks):** Identify the Dependencies
    - Identify the dependencies required by the sample application, such as the programming language, libraries, or any other software that needs to be installed.
- **Step 3 (15 marks):** Create a Docker file
    - Create a Docker file for the sample application. The Docker file should include the following instructions:
        - A base image that matches the operating system and architecture required by the application
        - Any required dependencies that need to be installed
        - Copy the source code to the container
        - Any necessary configuration changes
        - Specify the command to run when the container is started
- **Step 4 (25 marks):** Build the Docker Image
    - Build the Docker image using the Docker file you created in the previous step.
    - Verify that the image is built correctly and that all the required dependencies are installed.
- **Step 5 (25 marks):** Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub
    - Push the Docker image to your Docker Hub registry. Verify that the image is pushed correctly and that you can access it from the Docker Hub registry.
- **Step 6 (10 marks):** Create a GitHub Repository
    - Create a new repository on GitHub for the sample application.
- **Step 7 (15 marks):** Include a README.md file
    - Create a README.md file and document your findings for each command. For each command, provide a brief description of what it does, followed by the output and logs generated by the command. Ensure that the README.md file is well-organized, easy to read, and contains all necessary information.
- **Step 8 (5 marks):** Push the Codebase to GitHub
    - Push the codebase for the sample application to the GitHub repository you created in the previous step. Verify that the codebase is pushed correctly and that you can access it from the GitHub repository.

# Passing Criteria:
- The Docker file must be syntactically correct and include all the required instructions (Step 3).
- The Docker image must be built successfully without any errors or issues (Step 4).
- The Docker image must be pushed to Docker Hub successfully without any errors or issues (Step 5).
- The codebase must be pushed to GitHub successfully without any errors or issues (Step 7).
- The report must include all the required sections and be well-written with proper grammar and spelling (Step 8).
